# SZL Living Anatomy 🫀

> **Governed AI you can prove — as a living body.**
> A 3D, navigable map of the governed organism: its organs, how a single decision
> flows through them, and where each proof and conjecture honestly sits.

> **The living substrate · 5 systems · Λ heart · DSSE Khipu receipt bus · honest by design**

The governed-AI organ substrate shared by **a11oy** (governed-AI command body) and
**killinchu** (maritime / drone C2 body): two bodies, one circulatory + nervous mesh,
with the Λ heart at the center.

## What's new in v4 — dissection tools

v4 **evolves** v3 (it does not replace it): the entire v3 engine, organs, formulas,
YAWAR receipt bus, GPD lens, and text fallback are preserved. Layered on top are
bench-grade dissection controls so the body is *easier to dissect*:

- **Dissection layer stack** — toggle + opacity-slide the conceptual layers
  (circulatory · nervous · organs · skeleton/Khipu · halos/glow); choices persist in `localStorage`.
- **Clip-plane scalpel** — a sliding X/Y/Z cross-section (`renderer.localClippingEnabled`)
  cuts the organism so you can see the interior, with a reset.
- **Explode view** — an eased 0→1 slider separates the organ groups radially for inspection.
- **Search / jump** — filter organs + formulas by name/id; selecting one flies the camera and opens its panel.
- **Always-on visibility HUD** — a compact overlay reading **honest** counts straight from
  `data.js` (`D.KERNEL`): locked-proven = 8, experimental tier, axioms 14, sorries 163,
  kernel `c7c0ba17`, Λ = Conjecture 1, Khipu BFT = Conjecture 2. Never hardcoded.
- **Focus mode** — fade the other organs when one is selected, to isolate it.
- **yarqa flow compartments (CFD) — additive, off by default** — an *engineering-method*
  layer in the dissection dock that runs a clean-room plug-flow compartmentalization
  (`yarqa`) over the **existing** circulatory / YAWAR flow sampled from `data.js`, draws
  the compartments as a toggleable read-only overlay, and emits a reproducible integrity
  receipt digest. It is **labeled CFD, not a locked theorem, and is never counted among
  the locked 8** — `data.js` stays the single source of truth and the locked-proven count
  is unchanged at 8.
- **Accessibility + mobile** — every new control is keyboard-reachable and ARIA-labeled,
  laid out so it never overlaps the existing HUD/panel, and it respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Still sovereign: ONLY the vendored `lib/three.min.js` (THREE r160 global) — zero runtime
CDN, no npm, no build step. The site stays a static, offline-capable bundle.

## What you'll see

Walk the organism in 3D and watch a real decision propagate: a request enters, the
**YUYAY** gate scores it on 13 conjunctive axes (deny-by-default), the verdict is sealed
into a **DSSE Khipu receipt** on the **YAWAR** append-only bus, and the **YACHAY** read-only
cortex supplies reasoning without ever holding write authority. Each organ is labeled with
its honest proof state — proven, conditional, or open conjecture — so nothing is dressed up
as more certain than it is.

**Five systems:** HEART · YUYAY (13-axis conjunctive critique gate, emits Λ-signed receipt) ·
CIRCULATORY/BLOOD · YAWAR (append-only SHA-256 receipt bus) ·
BRAIN · YACHAY (read-only reasoning cortex) ·
NERVOUS · OTel/VSP · SKELETON · 12 service repos.

**Honest doctrine:** locked-proven = 8 {F1, F4, F7, F11, F12, F18, F19, F22} @ kernel `c7c0ba17`
(the no-axiom theorem `locked_count_eight`; F4 Khipu DAG acyclicity, F7 Chaski FIFO ordering,
F22 Khipu emit append-only monotonicity) ·
Λ unconditional uniqueness = Conjecture 1 (machine-checked FALSE); conditional Λ axiom-free PROVEN ·
Khipu BFT safety = Conjecture 2, with the Wave23 conditional agreement theorem
(`khipu_quorum_safety_conditional`, n≥3f+1 + honest non-equivocation, axiom-clean) ·
~185 experimental CI-green · trust never 100% · no AGI.

**Supply-chain posture:** this Space is a static visualization (`sdk: static`) — SLSA L1 honest.
The product images it depicts (**a11oy**, **killinchu**) are **SLSA L1 honest · L2 build-attested**
(container provenance via attest-build-provenance, Sigstore keyless, Rekor-anchored; L3 roadmap) —

## Verify it yourself

The organism is a map, not the source of truth — every claim it draws is checkable against the
live products it depicts:

```bash
# Confirm the live doctrine posture the heart reports
curl -s https://szlholdings-a11oy.hf.space/api/a11oy/v1/honest | jq .kernel_commit   # => "c7c0ba17"
# Pull a signed receipt from the edge organ and verify it offline
curl -s https://szlholdings-killinchu.hf.space/cosign.pub -o cosign.pub
```
