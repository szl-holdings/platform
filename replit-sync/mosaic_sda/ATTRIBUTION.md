## 1. Inspiration (capability only — NO code)

This engine is SZL's sovereign, clean-room answer to **True Anomaly Inc.'s
"Mosaic"** space-superiority platform. We were INSPIRED BY Mosaic's **publicly
described capability** — fusing space- and ground-based sensors into a dynamic
Common Operating Picture, accelerating the OODA loop, and supporting Space Domain
Awareness, with the public four-function SDA decomposition
**Detect/Track/ID → Characterize → ML Threat-Warning & Assessment → fuse/forecast**.

**No proprietary Mosaic source code, assets, screenshots, or internal interfaces
were seen, copied, decompiled, or referenced.** Mosaic itself is proprietary. We
clean-room the *capability* from public descriptions only. This is INSPIRATION,
not derivation.

## 2. Methods adopted (clean-room — implemented from scratch, with license)

We adopt only **verified-permissive** algorithm lineages. Each method below was
re-implemented from public papers/descriptions; upstream code was not vendored.

## 4. House license & posture

This package ships **Apache-2.0** (SZL house license), with `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`
reproducing each upstream license. Doctrine v11 applies throughout: Λ = Conjecture 1
(advisory, never proven trust); sovereign own-metal, 0 CDN; honest UNSIGNED
receipts; validation numbers are real on synthetic data; every $/credit = ESTIMATE.
