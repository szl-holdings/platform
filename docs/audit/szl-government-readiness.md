**Prepared by:** Stephen P. Lutar Jr. / SZL Consulting LTD  
**Meeting:** Empire APEX Accelerator – NYSTEC (Mercy McInnis, Procurement Counselor)  
**Date:** April 30, 2026  
**Classification:** Pre-Briefing — Government Sales Readiness

***

## Executive Summary

SZL Holdings operates three interconnected AI-powered platforms — A11oy (the orchestration control plane), Sentra (governed security and threat intelligence), and Amaru (data convergence and reconciliation) — built as a proof-bound, replayable, governed decision infrastructure stack. The platform is purpose-designed for high-consequence operations, making it uniquely well-positioned for government procurement under current federal and New York State AI requirements. This audit confirms the platform's strengths, identifies gaps to close before Tuesday's meeting, and maps every system to current government standards.

## Government Procurement Context

### Empire APEX Accelerator & NYSTEC
The Empire APEX Accelerator, managed by NYSTEC, provides free government contract counseling to businesses in New York State to help them compete for federal, state, and local government contracts. Since 2020, the program has assisted over 1,100 clients and aided in the award of more than 6,300 contracts totaling over $345 million. The meeting with Mercy McInnis is a counseling session designed to help SZL position for government contract pursuit.

### New York State AI Procurement Climate (2026)
New York is one of the most active states for government AI adoption right now:
- **DIGIT Agency**: Gov. Hochul has created the Office of Digital Innovation, Governance, Integrity, and Trust (DIGIT) under CIO Dru Rai to govern AI adoption and set vendor standards across 50+ state agencies, centralizing billions in procurement.
- **ITS Pro Deployment**: NY's Office of Information Technology Services has rolled out a generative AI tool called ITS Pro to 130,000 state employees, with scale-out through 2027 and enterprise agreements actively being scoped.
- **S.B. 7599 (AI Transparency Law)**: Gov. Hochul signed legislation requiring government agencies to publicly disclose AI tools and bias mitigation measures — a law that directly rewards vendors with built-in transparency and audit capabilities.
- **AI-Driven Procurement Initiative**: The 2026 State of the State includes a proposal to leverage AI to accelerate and simplify procurement across 1,200+ centralized contracts.

### Federal Requirements (DoD/GSA)
- **NIST AI RMF (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage)**: The authoritative federal AI risk management framework, increasingly referenced in procurement as a baseline expectation for AI contractors.
- **DoD Responsible AI Tenets**: Responsible, Equitable, Traceable, Reliable, Governable — the five principles contractors must align to for DoD work.
- **GSA GSAR 552.239-7001 (Proposed)**: Requires traceability, model routing rationale, RAG source attribution, human oversight mechanisms, 72-hour incident reporting, and NIST AI RMF documentation.
- **FedRAMP**: Cloud-hosted AI tools used in federal systems require FedRAMP authorization at appropriate baselines.
- **CMMC 2.0**: Contractors touching Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) must comply with NIST SP 800-171 requirements — no AI exemption.

## Platform Audit: A11oy

### What A11oy Is
A11oy is the orchestration control plane of the SZL Holdings platform — the agent ecosystem brain that routes tasks, enforces governance, powers Sentra and Amaru, and manages the Ouroboros loop kernel.

### Strengths (Government-Aligned)
| Capability | Government Alignment |
|---|---|
| Append-only trace runtime | Meets GSA audit trail and traceability requirements; DoD Traceable tenet |
| Decision receipt system | Meets "produce evidence on demand" audit requirements |
| Ouroboros loop with delta/consistency gates | Meets DoD Reliable and Governable tenets |
| Human approval gate for R3/R4 risk tiers | Meets GSA human oversight requirement; DoD Responsible tenet |
| Validator registry with hard stops | Meets NIST AI RMF MANAGE function |
| Replay/golden run verification | Meets audit reproducibility requirements |
| Domain pack routing | Meets NIST AI RMF MAP function |
| Budget governance | Meets economic stewardship requirements |
| Primary-source hash chain (Katzilla) | Meets GSA RAG source attribution requirement |

### Gaps to Address Before Tuesday
1. **FedRAMP Status**: A11oy is not yet FedRAMP authorized. For federal work, this must be disclosed as a roadmap item with a clear path (FedRAMP 20x or CSP partnership).
2. **CMMC Documentation**: If A11oy will handle any CUI, NIST SP 800-171 gap assessment is needed.
3. **Bias Testing Evidence**: Government buyers now require documented bias testing. Need a bias audit plan or results.
4. **Data Residency Statement**: Government clients need explicit confirmation that data does not leave US-controlled infrastructure.
5. **Incident Response Plan**: GSA requires 72-hour incident reporting; need a documented IR procedure.
6. **NAICS Codes**: SZL must have appropriate NAICS codes registered in SAM.gov (see Registration section).

### Readiness Score: 72/100
Strong on governance, proof, and traceability. Gaps are in certification path and formal documentation.

***

## Platform Audit: Sentra

### What Sentra Is
Sentra is the governed security and threat intelligence pack within the A11oy ecosystem, providing recursive threat modeling, regulated monitoring, security review, escalation workflows, and evidence-bound decision artifacts.

### Strengths (Government-Aligned)
| Capability | Government Alignment |
|---|---|
| Recursive threat loop with risk tiers R1–R4 | Aligns with NIST AI RMF MEASURE and MANAGE functions |
| Evidence pack generation | Meets DoD documentation requirements for security conclusions |
| SHA-256 primary-source hash via Katzilla | Preserves chain-of-custody for regulated data (FDA, FEMA, Federal Register) |
| Source hash register in receipts | Meets audit trail requirement for source attribution |
| Forced escalation at R4_critical | Meets DoD Governable tenet and GSA human oversight requirement |
| Validator: VAL_SECURITY_PROOF_REQUIRED | Ensures no security conclusions without evidence |
| Validator: VAL_APPROVAL_FOR_CRITICAL_ACTION | Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes security actions |

### Best-Fit Government Use Cases
- **Cybersecurity monitoring** for state/local agencies (NY Joint Security Operations Center covers 95,000 computers)
- **Regulatory signal monitoring** via primary-source Katzilla datasets (Federal Register, FEMA, CourtListener)
- **Threat analysis support** for DoD/defense subcontracting through NYSTEC network
- **Audit support services** — Sentra's receipt and trace outputs can serve as audit evidence

### Gaps to Address Before Tuesday
1. **SOC 2 Type II**: Government security buyers will ask for this. Not yet in place.
2. **Incident response runbook**: Need a formal runbook tied to Sentra's alert escalation paths.
3. **Threat intelligence feed documentation**: Need to formally document which primary-source feeds power Sentra.
4. **Penetration testing**: Government IT security will ask if the system has been pen-tested.

### Readiness Score: 68/100
Very strong architecture and proof chain. Needs formal security certifications and runbooks to satisfy procurement security reviews.

## Platform Audit: Amaru

### What Amaru Is
Amaru is the convergent data synchronization and reconciliation engine — it manages merge governance, conflict resolution, delta logging, and consistency enforcement across records, schema variants, and primary-source data.

### Strengths (Government-Aligned)
| Capability | Government Alignment |
|---|---|
| Append-only delta log | Meets data lineage and audit trail requirements |
| Consistency gate before commit | Meets data integrity requirements for government records |
| Source priority metadata | Meets data provenance requirements |
| Hash verification on ingest and replay | Meets chain-of-custody requirements |
| Consistency report output | Meets government records management standards |
| VAL_MERGE_SAFETY validator | Prevents unsafe data operations |
| Upstream hash register in receipts | Provides traceable data lineage artifacts |

### Best-Fit Government Use Cases
- **Government data consolidation** — merging records from multiple agency systems
- **Census, BLS, FRED data reconciliation** via Katzilla primary-source feeds
- **Property and asset record management** (NY state agencies manage significant real property)
- **Grant and contract data reconciliation** across agencies

### Gaps to Address Before Tuesday
1. **Data classification documentation**: Need to specify which data classifications (CUI, PII, public) Amaru handles and how.
2. **Retention policy**: Government data has specific retention requirements; need documented retention and deletion policies.
3. **Integration documentation**: Need clear API documentation showing how Amaru integrates with common government systems (e.g., COTS ERP).
4. **Privacy impact assessment**: Required for any system handling government PII.

### Readiness Score: 65/100
Architecturally sound for government data workflows. Needs data classification, retention, and privacy documentation.

## SAM.gov Registration Readiness

This is the single most important prerequisite for any government contract. You **cannot** receive a federal contract without an active SAM.gov registration.

### Required Steps for SZL Consulting LTD
1. **Get your UEI** (Unique Entity Identifier) at SAM.gov — free, takes 10–15 business days
2. **Register your entity** — legal business name must exactly match IRS records
3. **Select NAICS codes** — recommended codes for SZL:
   - **541511** — Custom Computer Programming Services
   - **541512** — Computer Systems Design Services
   - **541519** — Other Computer Related Services
   - **541690** — Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services
   - **541715** — Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences
4. **Complete Reps & Certs** — certify small business status, compliance with FAR provisions
5. **Annual renewal** — SAM registration must be renewed every year

### New York State Registration
- Register at **NY Contract Reporter** (nyscr.com) for state contracting opportunities
- Consider **MWBE certification** (30% MWBE goals are common in NY state contracts)
- Consider **SDVOB certification** if applicable (6% SDVOB goals)

## Competitive Positioning Statement

**For the meeting with Mercy McInnis:**

> "SZL Holdings builds governed AI decision infrastructure for high-consequence operations. Our three-platform stack — A11oy, Sentra, and Amaru — was built from the ground up with auditability, human oversight, and proof chains as first-class design requirements, not add-ons. Every agent action produces a cryptographically traceable receipt, append-only log, and source hash. We align with the DoD's five Responsible AI tenets, NIST AI RMF's Govern-Map-Measure-Manage functions, and the GSA's proposed traceability requirements. New York's new DIGIT agency and S.B. 7599 transparency law create exactly the procurement environment our platform was built for."
