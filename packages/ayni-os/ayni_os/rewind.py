"""Rewind — reconstruct empire state at a target timestamp T by replaying receipts.

HONEST NAMING: this is the EVENT-SOURCING REPLAY pattern. Given a target timestamp T,
we (optionally) start from the nearest signed checkpoint <= T, then re-apply every
KIPU receipt with ts <= T to deterministically reconstruct the state that existed at
moment T. It is NOT "time travel" and makes no physics claim — it is the same
mechanism used by event stores, write-ahead logs, and git.
