"""AYNI-OS — time-reversible (event-sourced) reciprocity runtime.

HONEST SCOPE:
- "Time-reversal" here means EVENT-SOURCING REPLAY: we reconstruct past state by
  re-applying an append-only log of signed KIPU receipts up to a target timestamp.
  This is the standard event-sourcing / event-store pattern. It is NOT
  "quantum time-travel" and makes no physics claim.
- "Ayni" is a GAME-THEORY PRIMITIVE: direct reciprocity / reciprocal altruism
  (Axelrod & Hamilton, Science 211(4489), 1981; Trivers, QRB 46(1), 1971). No
  mysticism, no ritual, no religion.
