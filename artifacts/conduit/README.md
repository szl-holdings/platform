Amaru — named for the Andean ouroboros — is the data-synchronization surface in the SZL Holdings portfolio. It consumes overlapping data streams from heterogeneous sources, runs them through a bounded reconciliation loop with measurable convergence, and emits per-record decision receipts via the Proof Chain.

## Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Live sync console — current convergence depth, in-flight loops, and per-source priority |
| `/sources` | Source-priority record (one of the proof artifacts required by `PRF_DATA_SYNC`) |
| `/loops` | Trace of every loop run — step-by-step delta, consistency score, and exit reason |
| `/receipts` | Decision-receipt browser — replayable, hash-verified |

## Ouroboros Codex — Amaru's Role

Per Ouroboros Thesis §8 (`docs/research/ouroboros-thesis-v2.md`), Amaru is the **convergent data-sync** archetype. It maps directly to the `PRF_DATA_SYNC` proof route in the v2 runtime contract (`docs/research/ouroboros-runtime-contract.v2.json`), which requires every committed merge to bind:

- a `source_priority_record` (which source won, and why),
- a `delta_log` (what changed step-by-step),
- a `consistency_score` (cross-step agreement, in [0, 1]),
- a `receipt` (the human-readable, replayable decision).

The loop is bounded by `LoopKernel` from `@workspace/ouroboros`, depth-allocated by `EntropyDepthAllocator`, and gated by `evaluateRiskTier` for any record whose merge crosses an R3+ tier (e.g. financial reconciliation, legal-entity unification).
