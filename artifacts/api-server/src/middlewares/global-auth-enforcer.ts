/**
 * Global Auth Enforcer (Deny-by-default)
 *
 * This middleware runs AFTER the auth hydrator (authMiddleware.ts) which populates
 * req.user / req.oidcUser. It enforces authentication for all /api/* routes by
 * default, returning 401 for unauthenticated requests unless the request path is
 * in the explicit public allowlist below.
 *
 * Public route groups:
 *  - Health endpoints (/api/health*)
 *  - Auth/login/register (/api/auth/*)
 *  - OIDC callbacks (/api/oidc/*)
 *  - Contact form (/api/contact)
 *  - Demo requests (/api/demo-requests)
 *  - Public status (/api/public/*)
 *  - Webhooks (/api/webhooks/*) — use HMAC authentication internally
 *  - SCIM 2.0 (/api/scim/*) — uses scimTokensTable bearer token auth (RFC 7643/7644);
 *    the SCIM auth is enforced within the SCIM router via scimBearerAuth middleware
 *  - Streaming webhook ingestion endpoints (/api/stream/webhook/*,
 *    /api/stream/ais-nmea) — use source token authentication (streamed-ingestion authToken)
 *  - SIEM webhook (/api/stream/webhook-siem) — NOT public; requires Bearer token auth
 *    (SIEM_WEBHOOK_TOKEN env var or a registered SIEM webhook data source authToken)
 *  - Streaming SSE read endpoints (/api/stream/siem-events, /api/stream/market-data,
 *    /api/stream/ais-tracking, /api/stream/status) — read-only live feeds used by dashboards
 *  - A2A Federation discovery endpoints (/api/federation/agents*, /api/federation/health)
 *    POST /federation/agents/:id/chat uses its own FEDERATION_API_TOKENS bearer token
 *  - DOS Public API (/api/v1/*)
 *  - API docs (/api/docs*, /api/docs.json)
 *  - CSRF token endpoint (/api/csrf-token)
 *  - Per-service health probes

 *   1. The TCP peer address (req.socket.remoteAddress — NOT req.ip, which is

 *      spoofable) is a loopback interface (127.0.0.1 / ::1).

 *   3. The request carries the `x-nexus-orchestrator: 1` header.
 *   4. The request path is in a hard-coded allowlist of safe, read-only
 *      orchestrator target endpoints.
 * Using req.socket.remoteAddress closes the X-Forwarded-For spoof vector: the
 * value comes from the kernel-reported TCP peer and cannot be set by a remote
 * client. The path allowlist further constrains the bypass to read-only
 * informational endpoints already exposed in PUBLIC_PREFIXES or via
