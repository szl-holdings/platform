## What We Are Building

SZL Holdings builds the **governed decision infrastructure layer** — the platform that connects what is observable to what is executable, under governance, with full attribution.

The accountability gap in enterprise operations is not a data problem. Organizations have dashboards. They have alerts. They lack a system that answers: *What do we do next? Who authorized it? What happened as a result? Can we prove it?*

We build that system.

## A11oy

**A11oy** is the flagship governed agentic execution fabric. It senses, structures, correlates, explains, recommends, approves, executes, verifies, and preserves cryptographic proof — in real time, across all SZL verticals.

Every step is instrumented. Every decision is attributed. No material action executes without human confirmation.

```
Signal → Context → Recommendation → Simulation → Policy → Approval → Execution → Proof → Outcome
```

**A11oy surfaces:**

| Surface | What It Provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Now Board** | Real-time prioritized signal stream across all verticals |
| **Command Surface** | Unified operator view — all pending decisions in one place |
| **Action Rail** | Human-approval queue — no action executes without confirmation |
| **Covenant Governance** | Policy enforcement — structural, not optional |
| **Proof Ledger** | Cryptographic audit trail — every decision, immutable |
| **Boardroom Mode** | Executive decision briefing with full attribution |
| **Operator Control Plane** | Agent orchestration with observable execution trace |
| **MirrorEval** | AI reasoning evaluation — closed-loop accuracy tracking |
| **Twin Foundry** | Digital twin simulation — confidence intervals before action |
| **Connector Firewall** | Governed integration layer — policy-gated data access |

## Platform Principles

**AI governance is structural, not policy-based.**  
Agents cannot execute consequential actions without human confirmation — enforced at the A11oy governance layer. There is no UI toggle to bypass it.

**Evidence-backed decisions.**  
Every AI recommendation includes source citations, confidence scores, and retrieval provenance. No opaque outputs.

**Immutable audit trail.**  
Every action, approval, and AI recommendation generates an append-only Proof Ledger entry with full decision provenance.

**Signal-to-outcome traceability.**  
From raw signal through routing logic through human approval through executed outcome — every step is logged, linked, and replayable. Zero black-box decisions.

## Trust & Governance

| Concern | Structural Response |
|---------|---------------------|
| AI without oversight | Advisory agents require explicit human confirmation — enforced at the A11oy governance layer |
| Opaque AI outputs | All recommendations include source citations, confidence scores, and retrieval provenance |
| Audit accountability | Every action generates an immutable Proof Ledger entry with actor attribution |
| Access control | 11-role RBAC with org-scoped tenant isolation, deny-by-default enforcement |
| Multi-tenancy | All queries scoped by org_id — cross-tenant access architecturally prevented |
| Data security | TLS 1.3, HMAC-signed WebSocket tickets (5-min TTL), encryption at rest |

> No SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, or ISO certifications claimed. Compliance readiness is a planned roadmap item.
